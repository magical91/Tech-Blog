On this week's assignment I created a CMS-style blog site. The user has the option to sign up and create a profile, or just surf through the pages without being able to interact with it. In the navigation you'll be given the option to either create a new post, visit the dashboard or login/logout. After creating a post you'll have tho option to either delete the post or the edit it. If you created an account and are logged in, you'll be able to comment on other people's posts.

## Purpose

A site to publish articles, blog posts, and any thoughts
